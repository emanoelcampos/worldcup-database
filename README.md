# World Cup Database 

*Learning Documentation*

This document serves as a record of my learning journey from the "World Cup Database" course, part of the relational database certificate from [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/relational-database). The project involved creating a `Bash` script to insert World Cup games data into a `PostgreSQL` database, and subsequently performing queries on the database to extract useful statistics.

## Database Diagram

The database structure can be visualized through the diagram. The diagram provides a clear representation of how the tables in the database are related and the type of data stored in each table.

## Bash Scripting and PostgreSQL

The project provided an opportunity to learn and practice `Bash` scripting and `PostgreSQL`. The Bash script was used to automate the process of inserting World Cup games data into the `PostgreSQL` database. This involved understanding the structure of the data, writing the script to read the data, and then using `SQL` commands to insert the data into the appropriate tables in the database.

## SQL Queries

After the data insertion, SQL queries were used to extract useful statistics from the database. This involved understanding the relationships between the tables in the database and writing complex `SQL` queries to join these tables and extract the required information. This process helped in gaining a deeper understanding of `SQL` and relational databases.

## What I Learned

Through this project, I gained hands-on experience with `Bash` scripting, `PostgreSQL`, and SQL queries. I learned how to automate data insertion into a database using a script and how to extract useful information from a database using `SQL` queries. This project was a practical application of the concepts learned in the "World Cup Database" course and served as a great learning experience.
