# World Cup Database

This project is a documentation of my learning from the "World Cup Database" course of the relational database certificate from [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/relational-database).

## About the Project

The main goal of this project is to insert World Cup games information into `PostgreSQL` and then perform queries on the database to obtain useful statistics.
